I wanted to learn a couple of new things this year. Dabbled in switching
automating parameterised report in markdown to quarto, and also wanted 
to have an online store of notes with code snippets so decided to have a go
at opening up this blog (which was really easy and something Ill probably add
a post about). Also wanted to pciked up more javascript visualising, basically 
using D3, which quarto can offer in reports that use R and python in the same 
script, which is nice.
