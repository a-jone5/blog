Dabbled in switching automating parameterised report in markdown to quarto, and also wanted to have an online store of notes with code snippets so decided to have a go at opening up this blog (which was really easy and something Ill probably add a post about). Also wanted to pciked up more javascript visualising, basically using D3, which quarto can offer in reports that use R and python in the same script, which is nice."
